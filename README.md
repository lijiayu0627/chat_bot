# Cross-border E-commerce Chatbot

## Introduction
Cross-border e-commerce businesses often struggle with handling repetitive customer inquiries, which can be time-consuming and impact the customer experience. To solve this, I propose an AI-powered assistant designed for cross-border e-commerce, providing quick and accurate responses to improve service efficiency.

## Project Overview
The proposed project involves developing a chatbot that allows customers to inquire about product information, shipping statuses, and other e-commerce-related concerns. Customers will input their questions, and the AI assistant will provide precise answers. The system will leverage OpenAI’s GPT-4o which is fine-tuned on e-commerce data.

## Technical Approach
   * Data Collection: Develop a web scraper to collect relevant e-commerce data, including product descriptions, customer reviews, shipping information, and frequently asked questions (FAQs).
Store the collected data in a structured format to make it easily accessible during model training and real-time querying.
   
   * Model Fine-tuning: Fine-tune OpenAI’s GPT-4o using the collected e-commerce data, training the model to understand and respond to specific cross-border commerce queries such as shipping policies, product availability, and order tracking.
Chatbot Development. 
   * Build the Chatbot using Flask: Customers will input their questions in natural language, and the Chatbot will process these inputs through the fine-tuned GPT-4o model. 
The Chatbot will then provide relevant answers related to product categories, shipping details, and transaction statuses. 
   
## Execcution Plan
* Week 4: I will write a Python class called DataProcessor to organize web data into structured formats, such as question-answer pairs and product-attribute dictionaries, to support the fine-tuning of the Chatbot.
* Week 5: I will implement OpenAI GPT-4o calls using Python and fine-tune GPT-4o with the structured data. Additionally, I will conduct basic performance tests on the model.
* Week 6: I will scrape information from e-commerce websites like Amazon, build a database, and fine-tune GPT-4o using the collected data. 
* Week 7: I'll create a simple web app with Flask and React, featuring user registration, login, and a chat interface for interacting with the AI assistant. Using socket programming for real-time communication, the server will call the fine-tuned GPT-4o API to provide solutions.
* Week 8: I will finalize the Chatbot and add some additional functions such as a "preferences" page where users can see their problem history and language preferences. 
* Finally, I will write user documentation for the Chatbot.
